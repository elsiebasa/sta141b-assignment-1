It is a quick exercise for you to get familiar with RStudio, Rmarkdown and GitHub. Please
edit the following R block and update the variables with your information. Then knit the document to either a pdf or html file.


```{r, echo = FALSE}
my_name <- "YOUR NAME"
```

Hello to the world, I am `r my_name`.
